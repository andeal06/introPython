# Functions Introduction


## What are functions?

Functions can be seen as a list of commands you are having the computer remember for easy use later on. Much like how variables are placeholders for data that we want to use later, functions are placeholders for a collection of things we want the computer to execute, or do, later one when we need. 

***All functions need to be placed at the top of our file after our imports, canvas, and turtle creation.***


### Example Function

```
def square():
    for i in range(4):
        t1.forward(90)
        t1.left(90)
```

Above is an example function that would make a square. The first line is where the function starts. `def`, define, tells the computer we are going to be making a function. After our `def` we can assign a name for our funtion. Just like with variables we learned about earlier functions can be named just about anything, so chose a name that makes sense to you and is easy to type. Remember, variables and function names are for us the programers to be able to easily read our code. To finish our `def` statement we follow our name with `():` to let the computer know what follows is going to be a part of our function. 

Functions are similar to loops in how we right them. Each line of code that we want included in our function to be used later needs to be indented one level. In the table above we have in our function a loop. We learned that loops also need to have the lines we want to repeat indented a level, so we indent once more for the loop to be made.
